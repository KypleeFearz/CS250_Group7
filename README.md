# Movie Theater Ticketing System – Software Design Specification

This repository contains our group project for the Software Engineering course.  
We are incrementally building a **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** for a **Movie Theater Ticketing System**.  

## Project Overview

The system allows users to:  
- Purchase tickets online with seat selection.  
- Cancel or reschedule tickets (subject to refund policy).  
- Receive digital tickets with a scannable entry code.  
- Managers can schedule screenings and configure auditoriums.  
- Secure payments are processed via an external provider.  

## Deliverable 2: Software Design Specification

This deliverable extends our initial Requirements Spec with:  
- **Software Architecture Diagram** (components & connectors).  
- **UML Class Diagram** (Screening, Auditorium, Seat, Order, Ticket, Payment, User Roles, Policy Values).  
- **Detailed class descriptions** (attributes with datatypes, methods with signatures).  
- **Development Plan & Timeline** (task distribution, responsibilities, schedule).  

## Repository Structure

/design
  ├── architecture.png   # Software Architecture Diagram (to be added)
  ├── uml_class.png      # UML Class Diagram (to be added)
  └── sources/           # Editable diagram files (e.g., .drawio, .uml)

  ├── SRS_v2.docx        # Full SRS including Design section (to be added)
  └── SRS_v2.pdf         # Exported version for submission (to be added)
```

## Team Responsibilities

For each assignment, tasks are redistributed among team members and completed collaboratively.  
Roles may change per deliverable, but all contributions are merged into a single master SRS document.  

⚠️ Each member must push **at least one commit** to the repository to receive credit.
